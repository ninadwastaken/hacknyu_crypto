# Safe Spend 

## Punishing Impulse Purchases

Our project is to make economics more accessible to the consumer. After a purchase it forces a part of your budget into a savings account that cannot be immediately touched. This amount is based on a tax which depends on the type of the product that is brought. For example a purchase for grocery goods will have a lower tax rate than a purchase for boba.


## Tax Rate 

We receive an input that is a memo. The memo contains information such as the goods that were purchased. From this we calculate what the tax rate is and we take a percentage of the total purchase and put that into savings.


| Input | Output                 |
|------|--------------------------------|
|<pre>Name of Store:           Value<br>Name of Item:            Value<br>Price of Item:           Value<br>Money in Discretionary:  Value<br>Saving Goals:            Value<br>Money in Locked Savings: Value</pre> |<pre>Tax Rate:                Value<br>Added Amount:            Value<br>Money in Discretionary:  Value<br>Money in Locked Savings: Value</pre>|

## Road Map
1. Launch with basic functionality. Three accounts, one for locked savings, one for unlocked savings, and one for discretionary. Transfer of money with algorithms.
2. Invest the money in the savings account.
3. Scanning Receipts.
4. Integration into payment platform.
5. Making this profitable with monetization and banking.


# Project Story

## Inspiration

_Would you still buy boba if it were 10 dollars instead of 7?_ We leverage markets to help consumers reach their savings goals and cut down on unnecessary spending.

## What it does

We use AI to determine an extra fee for items you want to buy, depending on their necessity. Every fee goes into a locked savings account, which helps consumers save and discourages people from making frivolous purchases. Prudent purchases are untaxed, incentivizing good decisions.

## What's next for Safe Stash

Because Safe Stash is currently a framework that requires manual input of receipts/transactions, the next step for Safe Stash is its integration into existing payment methods, which would allow for ease of use.

We also plan on developing better algorithms trained on custom data.
